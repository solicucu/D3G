## D3G:Exploring Gaussian Prior for Temporal Sentence Grounding with Glance Annotation
![d3g](./images/D3G.jpg)

### Datasets
- **Annotations**. We adopt the glance annotation released by [ViGA](https://github.com/r-cui/ViGA) for training. Specifically, we adapt the glance annotation to our framework in json format ( see in [dataset](./dataset/) ).
- **Features**. As for video features, we utilize the publicly available [features](https://rochester.app.box.com/s/8znalh6y5e82oml2lr7to8s6ntab6mav) for fair comparison following [MMN](https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MMN).

We will update complete code as soon as possible.
